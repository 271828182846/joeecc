Summary of changes from v0.01 to v0.02 (2015-08-05)
===================================================

	* Reworked a lot of code to make it more readable and have better

	* Tool that uses Ed25519 to verify OpenBSD "signify" signatures (does not
	support signature creation just yet and maybe never will)
	* Hash truncation for ECDSA is done properly now
	* Export script for OpenSSL curves is now included and a curve database is
	contained within the package
