Summary of changes from v0.06 to v0.07 (2016-xx-xx)
===================================================

	* ASN.1 parsing facility added to load EC public and private keys from PEM
	or DER representation. Facility is inactive if pyasn1 is not installed on
	the system.
	* Include Rigol oscilloscope curve in the curve database
	* Curve quirks are now modelled explicity instead of being a special
	exception for certain named curves. That way, custom behavior (such as
	setting key bits for EdDSA) can be used for any custom curve, not just
	Ed25519.

Summary of changes from v0.05 to v0.06 (2016-03-01)
===================================================

	* Refactoring of curve database, include now the origin and OIDs
	* Threw out some duplicate curves and instead added their names as aliases
	* Added generated OpenSSL testcases
	* Curve DB entries now have various means of displaying their pretty name
	* Heuristic to detect Koblitz curves

Summary of changes from v0.04 to v0.05 (2015-08-12)
===================================================

	* Critical bugfix in twisted Edwards addition that somehow slipped through
	all testcases before is now fixed.
	* Included all of DJBs SafeCurves (http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/)
	* Small bugfix in Tonelli-Shanks algorithm that would sometimes fail with
	very small probability (p = 1 / modulus)
	* Curve database is not initialize all at once now, but is generated lazy
	(i.e. on first use)

Summary of changes from v0.03 to v0.04 (2015-08-11)
===================================================

	* Massively refactored code to be able to deal with twisted Edwards
	curves, Montgomery curves and short-formed Weierstrass curves all similary
	ways (without explicit exceptions for Ed25519 and Curve25519)
	* Implemented conversion between domain parameters of twisted Edwards and
	Montgomery curves (both directions)
	* Implemented conversion of points of twisted Edwards to Montomery curves
	and back. This includes conversion of Ed25519 and Curve25519 points back
	and forth.

Summary of changes from v0.02 to v0.03 (2015-08-06)
===================================================

	* Updated the pysignify example to allow for signing, key generation and
	private to public key conversion. Does not support encrypted private keys.

Summary of changes from v0.01 to v0.02 (2015-08-05)
===================================================

	* Reworked a lot of code to make it more readable and have better
	performance, modularized the code in the ecc package
	* Use a secure RNG for everything (joeecc is still just a toy and not
	intended for any productive use!)
	* Support for DJB's Curve25519
	* Tool that uses Ed25519 to verify OpenBSD "signify" signatures (does not
	support signature creation just yet and maybe never will)
	* Hash truncation for ECDSA is done properly now
	* Export script for OpenSSL curves is now included and a curve database is
	contained within the package

Summary of features of v0.01 (2011-09-29)
=========================================

	* Elliptic curve cryptography in F_P
	* Examples for ECDSA, ECDH, ECIES
	* Examples with Brainpool curves and custom (user-generated) curves
